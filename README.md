# Battleships Game Instructions

Battleships is a turn-based game played on a 10x10 grid. Each player will have their own grid where they place their ships and track their attacks.

Each player will have the opportunity to place their ships on the grid. At the beginning of the game, you and the computer will place the same number of ships on your respective grids.
You will be prompted to choose the position, size, and direction (if the ship size is greater than 1) of each ship you want to place on your grid.
The computer will randomly place its ships on its grid without showing you their positions.
Once both players have placed their ships, the game will begin.

You will be prompted to enter the coordinates of the cell you want to attack on the computer's grid. For example, (0,1). Then the size with the number 1, 2 or 3 and lastly the direction "Right, Left. Up , Down" 
After your attack, the computer will automatically select a random cell on your grid to attack.
